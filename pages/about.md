**BioShack** is a business incubator and think tank where bioneers and citizen scientists come together to build apps and hacks that better our world. The organization supports a <abbr title="Do It Yourself">DIY</abbr> culture where information and technology are shared freely for the purpose of developing socially responsible solutions.

It was founded by <a href="https://megdna.github.io" target="_blank">Megan</a> in early 2011 at the beginning of the open science movement and was one of the first biohackerspaces in the San Francisco Bay Area. Many of the <a href="{{ site.baseurl }}/posts">projects</a> here came out of that original idea accelerator and members of this “citizen science brigade” are still active in the <abbr title="Free Open Source Software">FOSS</abbr> community.
